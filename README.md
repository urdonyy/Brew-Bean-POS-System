# POS System (PHP & MySQL)

A lightweight and efficient Point of Sale (POS) application built using **PHP** and **MySQL**.  
This system showcases essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations within a clean and user-friendly interface.

This project was developed as a **mini project** during my internship, under the guidance and mentorship of experienced professionals at my company.  
It reflects both my learning process and the application of industry best practices in building practical web-based systems.
